# 26b-fizzbuzz
This is a code challenge consisting of 3 steps, each step corresponds to a branch.

## Step-1
In this first step, I had to write a program that produces the following for any range of integer numbers:

  - "<i>fizz</i>" for numbers that are multiples of 3;
  - "<i>buzz</i>" for numbers that are multiples of 5;
  - "<i>fizzbuzz</i>" for numbers that are multiples of 15;
  - the number, if none of the above apply; 

Running the program with a range between 1-20 should produce the following result: <br>
"1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz"

<br>

## Step-2
In this step, I had to improve the previous solution to produce a report at the end of the output showing how many times the following were printed:

  - "<i>fizz</i>"
  - "<i>buzz</i>"
  - "<i>fizzbuzz</i>"
  - "<i>an integer</i>"

Running the program with a range between 1-20 should produce the following result: <br>
"1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz fizz: 5 buzz: 3 fizzbuzz: 1 integer: 11"

<br>

## Step-3
In this last step I had to build the visual interface for the previous solution, following the design specifications provided.

As practice, trial and error, seeking a solution and correcting the error are the best way to learn, **I built a complete app using HTML, CSS, and JS**.
